## Description

**Philosophers** is the mandatory threading exercise from the 42 curriculum.
The `philo` program simulates the dining philosophers problem: each philosopher
runs in its own thread, shares forks with neighbors, and must eat, sleep, and
think without data races, deadlocks, or incorrect death detection.

Each philosopher repeatedly takes two forks, eats, sleeps, and thinks. A separate
monitor thread checks whether a philosopher has gone too long without starting a
meal and stops the simulation on death or when every philosopher has eaten enough
times (optional fifth argument). Forks are protected with mutexes; philosophers
reserve both forks before locking them, then acquire the mutexes in a fixed
order to avoid deadlock.

## Instructions

### Build

```sh
make -C philo
```

### Run

```sh
./philo/philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep \
  [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

Examples:

```sh
./philo/philo 5 800 200 200
./philo/philo 5 800 200 200 7
./philo/philo 1 800 200 200
```

### Tests

```sh
make -C philo test
make -C philo norm
```

### How AI was used

AI tools (Cursor / Claude) were used for:

- Drafting and refining `docs/design.md` (mutex layout, lock order, test matrix)
- Reviewing concurrency and subject compliance on feature branches
- Designing fork reservation and turn-based scheduling to stabilize no-death test cases
- README and wording review

All simulation logic, mutex layout, and final code were written and verified by the
author (build, unit tests, and manual scenario runs).
